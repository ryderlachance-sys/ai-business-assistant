                AI Business Assistant (“we”, “our”, or “us”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data.
                This policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard information when you use our services.

            <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share data with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> Trusted vendors who assist with hosting, analytics, error tracking, or customer support. They are bound by confidentiality obligations.</li>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
            <p>
                We retain personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide services. 
                Access tokens and integration metadata are removed when you disconnect an integration or delete your account.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Security</h2>
            <p>
                We implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect personal data. 
                This includes encryption in transit, scoped access controls, and continuous monitoring.
                However, no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
